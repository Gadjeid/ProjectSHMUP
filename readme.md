# Game Enhancements

## Overview

This project is Project SHMUP (shoot 'em up). To enhance the player's experience, I have made several improvements to the base game via audio.

## Enhancements

### 1. **Royalty-Free Background Music**
   - I added royalty-free background music to the game. This music plays in the background, providing a more immersive and pleasant experience for the player. The music loops continuously and is designed to complement the gameplay without being distracting.

### 2. **Shoot Sounds**
   - I incorporated sound effects for firing shots. Now, the shots made from the ship make a sound, adding to the immersion and enjoyment of the game.
